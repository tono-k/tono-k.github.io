            <h2> ABSTRACT </h2>
            <div class="report">
                Health is undoubtedly the most important aspect of your life. 
                Taking proactive steps by monitoring your physical and mental health 
                is necessary to prevent diseases from affecting you; even the healthiest 
                people get sick and need to visit doctors and take medication. 
                This unfortunate reality has been reminded to us in recent years 
                with the pandemic. Managing and monitoring your health is indeed a 
                difficult task and requires a lot of time and effort. In fact, this 
                is precisely what the following blog discusses: it details the difficulty 
                of monitoring your health, describes the current software solutions and 
                proposes a new user experience for a super health application.      
            </div> <br><br><br>
            <h2> USER RESEARCH </h2>
            <div class="report"> 
                To understand patient needs, it is imperative to do research and to conduct a survey. 
                The most optimal way of doing so would be to partner with medical clinics and 
                hospitals directly. The idea would be for them to ask the patients waiting to be 
                called in to fill in a questionnaire. This would directly target the potential 
                consumers of the proposed mobile application. This is highly effective and 
                constructive. <br> <br> Another way I would go about researching the users would be to 
                host a survey on Google forms and to send it to my friends and my family. 
                However, this method isn’t as effective as the previously mentioned one. 
                I’ve come up with a few questions for the questionnaire. Since the topic 
                discusses medical issues, I would firstly remind them that the survey is 
                completely anonymous. I would then proceed with the following simple yet effective questions.
            </div>
            <div class="report"> 
                <ul style="font-size: smaller;">
                    <li>What is your age range? (MCQ) <br> Below 18 <br> 18 to 50 <br> Above 50  <br> </li> <br>
                    <li> Do you take medication on a regular basis? (MCQ) <br> Yes <br> No  </li> <br>
                    <li> How often do you forget to take your medication? (MCQ)<br> Never<br> Sometimes<br> Often <br> Always</li><br>
                    <li> How do you track the medication you take? (Short answer)<br>Enter Answer …<br></li> <br>
                    <li> Do you think it's effective? (MCQ)<br>Yes <br> No</li> <br>
                    <li> Do you frequently have doctor appointments? (MCQ)<br>Yes <br> No</li></li> <br>
                    <li> How do you currently book appointments? (Short answer)<br>Enter Answer …</li><br>
                    <li> Do you think it's effective? (MCQ)<br>Yes <br> No</li> <br>
                    <li> Do you think there should be an easier way to communicate with your doctor? (Long answer) <br> Enter Answer … </li> </ul>
                    The first question is asked in order to assess the primary group age targeted 
                    by the application. The other questions are asked in order to determine the 
                    current software solutions patients use and to see whether they think it is 
                    effective or not. Note that ideally, I would send this survey and get some feedback. 
                    Due to my time constraint, I did some research on the current situation.
            </div> <br><br><br>
            <h2> PROBLEM STATEMENT & CURRENT SOLUTIONS </h2>
            <div class="report">
                Maintaining your health is extremely difficult and takes a lot of commitment. 
                This is the main problem various software applications try to solve. Many mobile 
                reminder applications exist and have notifications and reminders to take medication. 
                They have demonstrated their usefulness in many experiments. For example, a study 
                was conducted that reveals, with 95% confidence, that patients who used a tracking 
                application were more likely to adhere to their medication than those who didn’t [1]. 
                Other studies such as [2] arrive at the same conclusion. For appointment reservations 
                in Quebec, RVSQ, and ClicSante are frequently used; they allow patients to book 
                consultations with doctors [3]. These applications fulfill their goal; however, they 
                don’t consider the frequent unavailability of free appointments which has become a 
                serious issue over the years and has led to an overall negative experience [3]. This 
                issue is becoming worse and these applications are not designed to tackle this issue 
                which stems from having a free health care system. It could be beneficial for patients 
                to have a quicker and more efficient way of communicating with doctors. There is truly 
                a need for an application that centralises many features that make it easier for patients to track their health.

            <h2> USABILITY TESTING </h2>
            <div class="report">
                I would make a few people that I know use the prototype. 
                I would then ask them to answer two main questions in a written format: 
                they would need to detail their experience using the application. 
                They would express their opinions on what they think is effective 
                in the design and in the user experience and what they think could 
                be improved. I asked a few friends for their opinion on my prototype. 
                They suggested a few changes such as making a vertical line in the 
                "create reminder" and "schedule meeting" buttons in order to improve the user experience.
            </div>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2> REFLECTION </h2>
            <div class="report">
                My proposed application fulfills the needs of patients. 
                The medication reminder feature is present and efficient. You can set 
                the reminder as "done" and you can track your progress by clicking on "view your history". 
                Furthermore, similarly to current solutions, it is possible to schedule an appointment 
                with a doctor at a specific location. You additionally have the option to send doctors a 
                message which gives them the opportunity to answer your questions on your symptoms and 
                medication. This facilitates the communication between patients and their doctors and is my attempt at solving the problem.
                The suggested application shows that effective user-centric design principles were applied. 
                First, the two main functionalities are clearly shown to the user with the large white buttons, 
                making it easy to use the application. Furthermore, it provides good feedback and informs you 
                what you can and can’t do. For example, when creating a new reminder, the "create" button is 
                greyed out until the patient fills all the necessary information. The metal blue color is 
                reminiscent of doctors and their apparel; it gives patients reassurance and reminds them of 
                the goal of this application. Moreover, it has been designed with accessibility in mind. The 
                contrasting colors demonstrated in the mockups are certainly helpful for people with visual 
                limitations to differentiate the different buttons and features.
