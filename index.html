            <h1>Super Health App</h1>
            <p class="date">Published on: February 21, 2025 <br> <br>Written by Anthony El-Khoury </p>
            <div class="report">
                Health is undoubtedly the most important aspect of your life. 
                Taking proactive steps by monitoring your physical and mental health 
                is necessary to prevent diseases from affecting you; even the healthiest 
                people get sick and need to visit doctors and take medication. 
                This unfortunate reality has been reminded to us in recent years 
                with the pandemic. Managing and monitoring your health is indeed a 
                difficult task and requires a lot of time and effort. In fact, 
                this is precisely what the following blog discusses: it details 
                the difficulty of monitoring your health, describes the current 
                software solutions and proposes a new user experience for a super health application.    
            </div> <br><br><br>
            <h2> User Research </h2> <br>
            <div class="report"> 
                To understand patient needs, it is imperative to do research and to conduct a survey. 
                The most optimal way of doing so would be to partner with medical clinics and 
                hospitals directly. The idea would be for them to ask their patients to fill in 
                a questionnaire while they wait to be called in. This would directly target 
                the potential consumers of the proposed mobile application. This is highly 
                effective and constructive. Another way I would go about researching the users 
                would be to host a survey on Google forms and to send it to my friends and my 
                family. However, this method isn’t as effective as the previously mentioned 
                one. I’ve come up with a few questions for the questionnaire. Since the topic 
                discusses medical issues, I would firstly remind them that the survey is 
                completely anonymous. I would then proceed with the following questions.
            </div>
            <div class="report"> 
                <ul style="font-size: smaller;">
                    <li>What is your age range? (MCQ) <br>Below 18 <br> 18 to 50 <br> Above 50 <br> <br> </li>
                    <li> Do you take medication on a semi regular basis? (MCQ) <br>Yes <br> No </li> <br>
                    <li>How often do you forget to take your medication? (MCQ)<br> Never<br> Sometimes<br> Often <br> Always</li><br>
                    <li>How do you track the medication you take? (Short answer)<br>Enter Answer …<br></li> <br>
                    <li>Do you think it's effective? (MCQ)<br>Yes <br> No</li> <br>
                    <li>Do you frequently have doctor appointments? (MCQ)<br>Yes <br> No</li></li> <br>
                    <li>How do you currently book appointments? (Short answer)<br>Enter Answer …</li><br>
                    <li>Do you think it's effective? (MCQ)<br>Yes <br> No</li> <br>
                    <li>Do you think there should be an easier way to communicate with your doctor? (Long answer) <br> Enter Answer … </li> </ul>
                The first question is asked in order to assess the primary group age targeted by the application. 
                The other questions are asked in order to determine the current software solutions patients 
                use and to see whether they think it is effective or not. Note that ideally, I would send 
                this survey and get some feedback. Due to my time constraint, I did some research on the current situation.

            <h2> Current Solutions </h2> <br>
            <div class="report"> Maintaining your health is extremely difficult and takes a lot of commitment. 
                This is the main problem various software applications try to solve. 
                Many mobile reminder applications exist and have notifications and reminders 
                to take medication. They have demonstrated their usefulness in many experiments. 
                For example, a study was conducted that reveals, with 95% confidence, that 
                patients who used a tracking application were more likely to adhere to their 
                medication than those who didn’t [1]. Other studies such as [2] arrive at the 
                same conclusion. For appointment reservations in Quebec, RVSQ, and ClicSante 
                are frequently used; they allow patients to book consultations with doctors [3]. 
                These applications fulfill their goal; however, they don’t consider the frequent 
                unavailability of free appointments which has become a serious issue over the years 
                and has led to an overall negative experience [3]. This issue is becoming worse and 
                these applications are not designed to tackle this issue which stems from having a 
                free health care system. It could be beneficial for patients to have a quicker and 
                more efficient way of communicating with doctors. 
            </div> <br><br><br>
            <h2> Problem statement </h2><br>
            <div class="report">
                The difficulty of managing your health is the main issue being targeted. 
                Keeping up with your medication can be very challenging. Additionally, 
                there is a problem with the public health care system that makes securing 
                an appointment reservation difficult; current software does not take that 
                into account and patients could benefit from a quicker way to communicate 
                with a doctor. In a nutshell, there is a need for an application that 
                centralises many features that make it easier for patients to track their health.

            <div class="report">
                My proposed application fulfills the needs of patients. 
                The medication reminder feature is present and efficient. 
                You can set the reminder as done and you can track your progress 
                by clicking on view your history. Furthermore, similarly to current 
                solutions, it is possible to schedule an appointment with a doctor 
                at a specific location. You additionally have the option to send doctors 
                a message which gives them the opportunity to answer your questions on 
                your symptoms and medication. This facilitates the communication between 
                patients and their doctors and is my attempt at solving the problem.
                The suggested design for the application reflects on a lot of good design principles. 
                First, the two main functionalities are clearly shown to the user with the large white
                buttons, which makes the application easy to use. Furthermore, it provides 
                good feedback and informs you what you can do. For example, when creating a 
                new reminder, the create button is greyed out until the patient fills all the 
                necessary information. The blue color scheme is reminiscent of doctors and their 
                apparel; it gives patients reassurance and reminds them of the goal of this 
                application. Moreover, it has been designed with accessibility in mind. The 
                contrasting colors demonstrated in the mockups are certainly helpful for people 
                with visual limitations to differentiate the different buttons and features.
